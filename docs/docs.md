<h1> 1. Introduction </h1>
ORCA is a no-code AI chatbot-building platform designed to enable users to create and deploy 
intelligent question-and-answer chatbots effortlessly. It leverages Large Language Models 
(LLMs) and Groq's high-speed inference engine to ensure adaptability and efficiency. 

## 1.1 Problem Statement 
Creating AI-driven chatbots typically requires extensive technical knowledge in machine 
learning and natural language processing (NLP). Many businesses and individuals face 
challenges when attempting to develop and deploy intelligent Q&A systems without the 
necessary coding skills. Existing platforms either demand coding expertise or are limited in 
functionality. The lack of a user-friendly, no-code solution hinders the potential for widespread 
adoption and usability of AI-powered chatbots. 

## 1.2 Objectives 
The goal of this project is to develop ORCA, a no-code AI chatbot-building platform that 
allows users to effortlessly create, configure, and deploy AI-powered Q&A chatbots without 
requiring programming skills. The specific objectives are: 

1. To create an intuitive, user-friendly platform for building AI chatbots. 
2. To enable real-time, context-aware conversations using large language models (LLMs) 
and Groq’s inference engine. 
3. To allow easy integration with external systems via API endpoints. 
4. To provide scalability for hosting multiple chatbot instances. 
5. To support diverse input formats like blogs, websites, PDFs, JSON, images, and voice 
inputs for chatbot training. 
6. To facilitate the sharing of custom chatbots via API, increasing the platform’s 
accessibility. 

## 1.3 Application 
ORCA can be applied across various domains such as:

**• Customer Support:** Automating responses to frequently asked questions and assisting 
customers with product inquiries. 

**• Education:** Building interactive chatbots that guide students through educational 
content and answer academic questions. 

**• Research:** Creating chatbots to facilitate research by providing users with relevant
information based on a set of documents or queries.

**• Business Automation:** Streamlining business processes like feedback collection, 
scheduling, and information dissemination via chatbot interactions.
